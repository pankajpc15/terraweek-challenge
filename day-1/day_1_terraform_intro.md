**What is Terraform?**
Terraform is like a blueprint for your cloud infrastructure. Imagine it as a recipe book where you write down all the ingredients (resources) and instructions (configuration) needed to set up your infrastructure. Terraform then reads this “recipe” and makes sure everything is cooked just right.

**Why Use Terraform?**
Consistency: Just like using a recipe ensures every cake tastes the same, Terraform ensures your infrastructure is consistently set up across different environments.
Automation: Instead of manually setting up servers, databases, etc., you write code to automate the process.
Version Control: Track changes to your infrastructure code, similar to how you track changes to your codebase.
